Starting Out
Hi everyone, 
An introduction to me: I have coding knowledge and skills from WSUV and Clark College. 
I am exploring the coding and design world on my own and have yet to obtain a career in the developing/designing field.
I know HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQUERY,PHP, and servers such as KiTTy.
