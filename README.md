Testing it out
Hi everyone, 
I have coding knowledge and skills from WSUV and Clark College, but have not created many projects on my own for fun
because life gets busy and I haven't been very motivated.. I have never created my own GitHub before but I've looked at some
projects on here and I'm new to this interface. It seems a bit confusing to me but I hope I can be inspired by other people's
projects.
I know HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQUERY (but it's not my favorite thing to code), and some small amounts of PHP and servers such as KiTTy.
